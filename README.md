# Introduction to SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) in C++

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a popular cross-platform development library written in 
C/C++. It provides a simple and efficient way to access various multimedia components, 
such as graphics, audio, and input devices, making it a powerful tool for developing games, 
multimedia applications, and other interactive software.

## Key Features
- Graphics: SDL allows you to create and manipulate graphical elements, including windows, surfaces, rendering, and image loading. It supports hardware acceleration, providing smooth and high-performance graphics rendering.
- Audio: SDL enables you to play and manipulate audio streams, music, and sound effects. It supports various audio formats and offers functionality for audio mixing and playback control.
- Input Handling: SDL provides an easy-to-use interface for handling user input, including keyboard, mouse, joystick, and gamepad events. It simplifies the process of capturing and responding to user interactions.
- Window Management: SDL offers utilities for creating and managing windows, including multi-window support, window resizing, and fullscreen mode.
- Networking: SDL includes networking functionality, allowing you to create networked applications and games by providing sockets, IP address handling, and data transmission capabilities.
- Platform Independence: SDL is designed to be platform-independent, making it compatible with different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. This allows you to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms.
